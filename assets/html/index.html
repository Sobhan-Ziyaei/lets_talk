  <h2>Grammar explanation</h2>
  <p>
    Some adjectives go with certain prepositions. There are no grammatical rules
    for which preposition is used with which adjective, so it's a good idea to
    try to learn them together. To help you do this, write new vocabulary in
    your notebook in a sentence or phrase.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, there are some patterns that can help you. Let's look at them
    first. Remember that a preposition is followed by a noun or a gerund (<em
      >-ing</em
    >
    form).
  </p>
  <h3>With <em>at</em></h3>
  <p>
    We use <em>at</em> with adjectives like
    <em>good</em
    >/<em>bad</em>/<em>amazing</em>/<em>brilliant</em>/<em>terrible</em>, etc.
    to talk about skills and abilities.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <em
        >He's really <strong>good at</strong> English.<br />
        She's <strong>amazing at</strong> the piano.<br />
        They're <strong>terrible at</strong> organising anything.<br />
        I'm not very <strong>good at</strong> drawing.</em
      >
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>With <em>about</em></h3>
  <p>
    We often use <em>about</em> with adjectives of feelings like
    <em>angry</em
    >/<em>excited</em>/<em>happy</em>/<em>nervous</em>/<em>sad</em>/<em>stressed</em>/<em>worried</em>,
    etc. to explain what is causing that feeling.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <em
        >I'm <strong>angry about</strong> the decision.<br />
        He's <strong>nervous about</strong> the presentation.<br />
        She's <strong>excited about</strong> the new job.<br />
        They were <strong>worried about</strong> the exam.</em
      >
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>With <em>of</em></h3>
  <p>However, sometimes we use <em>of</em> with feelings.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <em
        >She was <strong>afraid of</strong> telling her mum.<br />
        I'm <strong>frightened of</strong> having an accident.<br />
        He's <strong>scared of</strong> flying.<br />
        You should be <strong>proud of </strong>your progress.</em
      >
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>With <em>to</em></h3>
  <p>We can use <em>to</em> to show the connection between people or things.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <em
        >He's <strong>married to</strong> the director.<br />
        I'm <strong>addicted to</strong> my phone.<br />
        I'm <strong>allergic to</strong> nuts.<br />
        It's <strong>similar to</strong> the old one.</em
      >
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    We can also use <em>to</em> to talk about someone's behaviour towards
    someone else.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <em
        >They were really <strong>friendly to</strong> me.<br />
        Was he <strong>nice to</strong> you?<br />
        He is always <strong>polite to</strong> everyone.<br />
        She was very <strong>rude to</strong> the waitress.</em
      >
    </p>

        >Exercise is <strong>good for</strong> you.<br />
        Stress is <strong>bad for</strong> you.<br />
        The town is <strong>famous for</strong> its cheese.<br />
        I'm <strong>responsible for</strong> the financial side of the
        business.</em
